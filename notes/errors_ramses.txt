    PARAMETER ERRORS

    - levelmin is too big or too small for ic_files:
        
        coarser grid is not compatible with initial conditions file
        Found    n1=         128  n2=         128  n3=         128
        Expected n1=         256  n2=         256  n3=         256

    - npartmax incorrect
        Maximum number of particles incorrect
        npartmax should be greater than     4000001
        
        Solution:
        npartmax = Maximum number of particles that can be allocated during the run within each MPI process. The number of particles is nparttot resp. 2^(levelmin)  (1 particle per grid initially created). So calculate npartmax = ngridmax/ncpus.

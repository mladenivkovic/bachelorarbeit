GENERAL NOTES ON RAMSES

This document contains my notes on ramses - how it works, what does what etc.


- ic_files and initial conditions
    ramses initially creates one particle per cell. The particles are then 
    displaced according to a displacement field given by the initial 
    condition file.
    To compute a smaller simulation, compile and run 
    /ramses/trunk/ramses/utils/f90/degrade_grafic.f90. The syntax is 
    degrade_grafic.out directory-with-ic-files/ directory/where/output/goes

- calculating npartmax
    npartmax = Maximum number of particles that can be allocated during the 
    run within each MPI process. The number of particles is nparttot resp. 
    2^(levelmin)  (1 particle per grid initially created)
    So calculate npartmax = ngridmax/ncpus.

- memory usage
    In the logfiles, you will find after each calculating step the amount of 
    memory used. It should not exceed 4GB. If it does, raise the number of 
    CPUs you use or execute a smaller simulation.

- levelmax
    the maximal value for levelmax seems to be 31 (starting with levelmin=7,
    so maybe levelmin + 24?)

- /ramses/trunk/ramses/utils
    Contains visualising and postprocessing tools.
